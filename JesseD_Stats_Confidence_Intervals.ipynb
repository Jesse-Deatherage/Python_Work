    "# Statistical Inference and Confidence Intervals\n",
    "Credit: Matt Brems, Riley Dallas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Explain the relationships among parameter, sample, statistic, and population.\n",
    "- Define and describe sampling distribution.\n",
    "- Describe the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "- Generate and interpret a theoretical confidence interval.\n",
    "- Bonus: Generate and interpret a bootstrapped confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Video Game Example\n",
    "Let's say you are playing a video game (like \"Halo\" or \"Call of Duty\") where the goal is to kill your opponent. Additionally, let's say your opponent is invisible.\n",
    "\n",
    "When deciding which weapon to use, you have two options:\n",
    "- a sniper rifle with one bullet in it, or\n",
    "- a grenade launcher with one grenade in it. \n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary>Which weapon would you prefer?</summary>\n",
    "    \n",
    "- You're likely going to prefer the grenade launcher!\n",
    "- Why? Well, an explosion from a grenade will cover more area than one bullet fired from a rifle.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/halo3.gif)\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the same as the logic behind confidence intervals. By calculating a statistic on a sample, ***maybe*** we get lucky and our statistic is exactly equal to our parameter... however, we're probably not going to get this lucky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polling Example\n",
    "\n",
    "You're running for office in a small town of 1,000 voters. Everyone in your town cares deeply about voting, so all 1,000 of them are going to vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'd like to ask \"All in all, do you think things in the nation are generally headed in the right direction?\""
